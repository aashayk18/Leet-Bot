# LeetBot

LeetBot is a GitHub automation tool that allows users to post their solutions for LeetCode questions to a GitHub repository of their choice.

LeetBot replaces the repetitive motions of copying and pasting solutions from LeetCode to GitHub with a few simple clicks that allow users to effeciently post their solutions to their GitHub repository. 

Built for and by students, LeetBot is a handy tool for learners wanting to keep track of their coding progress and journey. We aim to provide students the ability to automate their work, while also giving them the freedom to customize their details.
